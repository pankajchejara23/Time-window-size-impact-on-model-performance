Has the massive growth of online shopping improved upon the life of the consumer?<br/><br/>Perhaps one of the greatest benefits of online shopping is the added conveniance of being able to purchase things without leaving your house and having it delivered to your doorstep. This can be seen from the rise of startups like Bolt and Wolt. Buying things online is also usually cheaper than in-store, because there is no middle man who takes a cut of the profits and there is generally a field where you can enter a coupon code that you can find online easiliy. The common adaptation of online shopping has given rise to many stores who sell similar goods, which means that you can commonly find the same product cheaper on a different site and you have more variety in products.<br/><br/>However, there are strong arguments against online shopping. The main disadvantage would be the fact that you get no assurance on what you're buying. What is more, it is easier to get scammed shopping online. But perhaps one of the most annoying issue is that of shipping which can be slow and expensive. Since online shopping has been made so easy for the consumer, we can easily lose our sense of spending and overspend.<br/><br/>On the whole, online shopping comes with a lot of advantages and downsides. Since online shopping is so effortless we need to be able to be wary of our shopping habits.<br/>",0,2,0,0,0,0.4714045207910317,1.247219128924647,0.4714045207910317,0.0,0.0,87,eng,role-based,morning,6,C1,T15,english

Because women can make money just as well.<br/><br/><br/>Men are better cooks. Men should cook more. Women make food because men don't bother.women always complain that men don't bother to cook but men have been proven to be better cooks than women.If women don't bother then just order food. You can also go to a restaurant to eat.<br/>1. Women worry more about their diet than men.<br/>I think that men and women have a different perception of being fat. Men and women approach weight loss differently. Losing weight is usually important to women. If the men don't see their weight as a problem, they're not going to do anything because many times they are happy so.<br/>2. Young people today eat less healthily than ten years ago.<br/>I agree because nowadays young people eat lots of genetically modified and junk food, which is harmful. In addition, living conditions and lifestyles have changed and physical activity has decreased. Finally, teenagers usually ignore their parents` advice to eat more fruit, vegetables and dairy products.<br/>3. Men cook as a hobby, women cook because they have to.<br/>I think that women are more likely than men to say the primary reason they cook at home is because they want to cook for their family, while men are more likely than women to consider cooking a hobby.<br/>4. Vegetarians are healthier than people who eat a lot of meat.<br/>I don’t fully agree because although most vegetarians diets are lower in fat, cholesterol and with a high amount of fiber, I think the person needs be sure that he is getting enough nutrients, because if he doesn't eat a proper vegetarian diet can do more harm than benefit.<br/>Neither, not all diets with meat in them are bad for the body because if you avoid meat with fat and incorporate fiber, grains, vegetables, and fruit into the diet you will be able to stay healthy.<br/>5. You can often eat better in cheap restaurants than in expensive ones.<br/>It depends. I believe it is not necessarily true, in expensive restaurants can offer us products not as accessible as oysters, caviar, or culinary delights and also they use high quality products. Furthermore, sometimes in cheap restaurants can offer us homemade meals made with natural ingredients but they can also use lower quality products.<br/>6. Every country thinks that their cooking is the best.<br/>It depends on the country which we are talking. I think that the people who live in developed countries believe that theircooking is the best and that the people who live in poor countries know they haven’t the best diet in the world.<br/><br/><br/>",0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,104,eng,role-based,evening,9,C4,T15,english
