## üìú Abstract
Multimodal Learning Analytics (MMLA) leverages diverse data sources to assess collaboration quality in educational settings. A key question addressed in this study is how the choice of time window size impacts the generalizability of these models across different contexts. Using audio and log data, our findings reveal optimal window sizes for various collaboration dimensions, with significant implications for MMLA research and practice.

## üß™ Methodology

*Dataset and Feature Extraction*

The study utilized multimodal datasets collected from collaborative learning activities in diverse classroom settings. These datasets included audio and log data, from which features such as speaking time, turn-taking, and writing activity metrics were extracted. Group-level features were computed using statistics like mean and standard deviation.

*Window Size Segmentation*

To investigate the impact of time window size, data was segmented into windows of varying lengths (30s, 60s, 90s, 120s, 180s, and 240s). Labels for each window were assigned based on the majority annotation within the segment.

*Model Development*

Random forest classifiers were employed to model collaboration quality and its dimensions. The choice of random forest was driven by its proven performance in MMLA tasks. Models were evaluated using:

* 10-fold Cross-Validation (CV): Assesses within-context generalizability.

* Leave-One-Context-Out Validation: Measures across-context generalizability.

*Evaluation Metric*

The Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC) was used to evaluate model performance, providing a robust measure of prediction quality.

## üìä Results

Key findings:
- **Collaboration Quality & Argumentation:** Optimal performance with a **60-second window size**.
- **Other Dimensions (e.g., Coordination, Information Processing):** Best performance with 180-second windows.
- **Across-context Generalizability:** Models trained with larger windows (e.g., 180s) exhibit higher generalizability across diverse learning settings.
