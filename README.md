## üìú Abstract
Multimodal Learning Analytics (MMLA) leverages diverse data sources to assess collaboration quality in educational settings. A key question addressed in this study is how the choice of time window size impacts the generalizability of these models across different contexts. Using audio and log data, our findings reveal optimal window sizes for various collaboration dimensions, with significant implications for MMLA research and practice.

## üìä Results

Key findings:
- **Collaboration Quality & Argumentation:** Optimal performance with a **60-second window size**.
- **Other Dimensions (e.g., Coordination, Information Processing):** Best performance with 180-second windows.
- **Across-context Generalizability:** Models trained with larger windows (e.g., 180s) exhibit higher generalizability across diverse learning settings.
